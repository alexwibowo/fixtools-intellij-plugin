# FIXTools - IntelliJ plugin

The FIX Protocol Message Parser plugin for IntelliJ provides a powerful tool for developers working with the Financial Information Exchange (FIX) protocol. This plugin allows users to parse FIX messages and view their components in an intuitive, expandable tree structure, making it easy to analyze and debug FIX messages. 

One of the standout features is the ability to use your own custom FIX dictionary, enabling you to tailor the plugin to your specific requirements or proprietary message formats. Whether working with standard or custom fields, the plugin enhances productivity by providing a clear, organized view of complex FIX messages.

If you love this plugin, and would like to support me in maintaining it, you can spare some change here:
